## Questions
###  Export Data
it said 
>At the end create buttons on every page if we click on that button it will ask select columns from the table and show two buttons PDF or EXCEL, so download required file according to user selection.


It is not clear who can download what data. it said  'every page'. But it also said 'Admin can also export all books and user data as EXCEL file.'

So I put the button on every page. But only admin can  export  books and users. every one can export books. 

It exports all the books, not only on the current page.

On the top there is a button to export all books and user data as EXCEL file for admin. 

On the bottom there is a button to ask which columns from the table, and which format you want
